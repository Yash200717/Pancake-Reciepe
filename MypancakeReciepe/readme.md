About Pancake!

There’s nothing better than a stack of hot, fluffy pancakes to get your morning started. Most people think pancakes are too much preparation and work to serve as a quick breakfast, but they don’t have to be. You can whip up a batch up delicious flapjacks in as little as fifteen minutes by keeping the necessary ingredients on hand, mixing up a simple batter and cooking several pancakes to perfection at a time.
